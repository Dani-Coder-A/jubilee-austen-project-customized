               <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
               <div class="half-width">
                  <p>I was born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio, and I live in what is easily described as one of the most quaint, little villages in the area&hyphen; 
                     think Tudor style homes and tree-lined streets. Since obtaining a degree in English, I've had a bit of a hodgepodge career path, dabbling in legal
                     and government settings, as well as working for mom-and-pop shops.
                  </p>

               <div class="half-width">
                  <p>Once I sat down and asked myself what I was looking for in a career, I realized tech just made sense. It allows me to be creative but it's also 
                     structured, which I love. Tech gives me the freedom &amp; versatility that I was lacking in my previous work. I am making the switch to front-end 
                     development, and can't wait to start writing clean, elegant code.

                  <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
                  <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot, 
                     and accessible.</p>

                  <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
                  <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay 
                     up to date on current best practices.</p>

                  <p>You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly &amp; accurately convert it into a webpage that is a pixel-perfect match.</p>
